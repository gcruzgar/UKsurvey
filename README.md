# UKsurvey

The objective of this project is to visualise the transitions that occur in the microsynthesis of population.  
Understanding Society data is used to complement ONS census data.

Data can be downloaded from UK Data Service: https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/series/series?id=2000053
    Requires registration in the UK Data Service website. 

More information on the survey can be found here: https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk

For now, the repository is a list of scripts I am using for analysis.

Things to do:
- update Readme
- could use ukcensusapi module to obtain census data
- create python module
