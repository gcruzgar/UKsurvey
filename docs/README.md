### Household Distributions

household_distributions.xlsx shows the distributions for some variables in Understanding Society.

Variables included:
- composition
- tenure
- number of bedrooms
- number of rooms (that are not bedrooms)
- total number of rooms
- number of occupants
- urban/rural split

It also has the correlations between said variables (only first rooms variable).

### Comparing Census and Survey data

comparing_census_survey.xlsx compares distributions in wave c (2011) Understanding Society to those in the 2011 Census.     
Only compares the 5 dimensions needed for population seeding: 

- tenure
- total number of rooms
- number of occupants
- number of bedrooms
- composition

There is one sheet per variable. The data is first converted to percentages and then plottedbased on category, such that the census and survey percentages are plotted in bars next to each other. The sum of same-coloured bars is 100%. A scatter plot is also included to get a coeffcient of determination for survey against census. The number of data points is quite low so the numbers are inflated.
