### Household Distributions

household_distributions.xlsx shows the distributions for some variables in Understanding Society.

Variables included:
- composition
- tenure
- number of bedrooms
- number of rooms (that are not bedrooms)
- total number of rooms
- number of occupants
- urban/rural split

Each variable has a set of plots. Most include a stacked bar chart displaying the contribution of each category to the total. Each colour is a category and each column is a wave. There are also clustered column charts showing the same information as the bar charts but in a different way so that comparing between years is easier. In this case, each cluster of columns is a category and each colour represents a wave. The sum of same-coloured bars is the total for that year (100 as it is a percentage).         
It also has the correlations between said variables (only first rooms variable).

### Comparing Census and Survey data

comparing_census_survey.xlsx compares distributions in wave c (2011) Understanding Society to those in the 2011 Census.     
Only compares the 5 dimensions needed for population seeding: 

- tenure
- total number of rooms
- number of occupants
- number of bedrooms
- composition

There is one sheet per variable. The data is first converted to percentages and then plotted based on category, such that the census and survey percentages are plotted in bars next to each other. The sum of same-coloured bars is 100%. A scatter plot is also included to get a coeffcient of determination for survey against census. The number of data points is quite low so the numbers are inflated.
